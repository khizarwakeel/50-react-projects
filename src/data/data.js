        question: 'What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?',
        answer: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems. These machines can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.'
    },
    {
        id: '2',
        question: 'What is the difference between Narrow AI and General AI?',
        answer: 'Narrow AI (or weak AI) is designed to perform specific tasks like facial recognition or language translation, and it operates within predefined boundaries. General AI (or strong AI), which does not exist yet, would have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do, with the ability to learn and adapt across different domains without explicit programming.'
    },
    {
        id: '3',
        question: ' What are some real-world applications of Generative AI?',
        answer: 'Generative AI has various applications, including creating realistic images, videos, and music (e.g., DALLÂ·E, MidJourney), generating text content (e.g., ChatGPT, Jasper AI), designing graphics, automating customer service through chatbots, and assisting in software development by generating code snippets or entire programs.'
    },
    {
        id: '4',
        question: 'What is a chatbot, and how does it work?',
        answer: 'A chatbot is an AI-driven software application that simulates human conversation through text or voice interactions. It works by using natural language processing (NLP) to understand user input and generate responses based on pre-trained models, like GPT. Chatbots are commonly used in customer service, virtual assistants, and conversational AI platforms.'
